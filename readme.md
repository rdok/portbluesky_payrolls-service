> Generates company payrolls. Serverless GraphQL to calculate the dates on which to pay sales staff.
 
# Acceptance Criteria

- Sales staff are paid a regular Ô¨Åxed base salary each month, plus a regular monthly bonus.
- Base salaries are paid on the last day of each month, unless that day is a Saturday or Sunday (a weekend), in which case they are paid on the Friday before the weekend
- On the 15th of each month, bonuses are paid for the previous month, unless that day is a weekend, in which case they are paid on the first Wednesday after the 15th.
- Accept a date as a parameter, and return the payment dates for the following 12 months, including the supplied date. Results should be returned in CSV format.
- The API is consumed a browser-based company intranet, written in a frontend framework such as React.
